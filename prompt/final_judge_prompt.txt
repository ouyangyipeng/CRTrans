Given a C source file and its Rust translation, provide a detailed equivalence assessment.
Output a Markdown report with sections:
- Summary (overall equivalence verdict and confidence 0-100)
- Functional Equivalence (whether outputs and side effects should match; note any divergences)
- UB/Memory Safety Notes (potential undefined behavior in C and whether Rust mirrors/avoids it)
- API/IO Differences (stdin/stdout formatting, exit codes)
- Type/Overflow Considerations
- Suggestions (up to 3 concise fixes if not equivalent)

C ({c_name}):
{c_code}

Rust ({rust_name}):
