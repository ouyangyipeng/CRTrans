You are a Rust engineer. Fix the provided Rust source so that its observable behavior matches the C reference outputs for the given sample inputs. Adjust logic, types, and printing as needed; avoid unsafe unless required. Return the full corrected Rust file with no Markdown fences.

Current Rust code:
{c_function}

Observed output mismatches (Rust vs C):
{static_hint}

Keep function names stable unless renaming is necessary to resolve conflicts.
