Translate the C function below to Rust. Use the provided target signature exactly. Avoid unsafe unless necessary; prefer slices, references, and Result/Option. Use already translated callees when present. You may leverage the static hint from c2rust for type clues but clean up unsafe patterns.
Target signature:
{target_sig}

C function:
{c_function}

Translated callees (signatures):
{callee_sigs}

Static hint (from c2rust, may be noisy):
{static_hint}

Respond with Rust code that starts with the target signature.
